        "- When moving to a new city one has limited information on the new city; however, using a comparison of known neighborhoods in the current city compared to a new city may help one familiarize with neighborhoods to potentially move to.\n",
        "- I propose using Foursquare data to cluster neighborhoods across cities to identify similarities in neighborhoods between cities.\n",

        "###  Data and approach\n",
        "- I'll create a list of neighborhoods in both San Antonio and Dallas cluster them as if they were in the same city.\n"
